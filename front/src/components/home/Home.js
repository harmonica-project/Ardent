            <p>
                I developed this app to input architectures, components, and properties to form a knowledge base and extract patterns later.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Here is a quick tutorial -</b> first, change the user in the corner-right of the app as yourself. Then, 
                for each paper, create a new architecture, add a reference to the paper and a short description, then 
                select the components and their properties that are present into the architecture described in the paper. 
                If a component or a property does not exist yet, you can just create it! 
                And if you need help, feel free to PM me on Slack <a href="https://app.slack.com/client/TEG1QQZ0A/DTCQNE7KR">@Nicolas Six</a>.
